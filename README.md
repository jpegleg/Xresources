# Xresources

This is my .Xresources file base.

What it does:
- changes the background to black
- changes foreground to grey
- changes blue to easier to read
- enlarges font to size 20
- enables copy and paste
- enables scroll up and down
- sets scroll back to 10000 lines

Installation example:

```
mv Xresources ~/.Xresources
xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
```
